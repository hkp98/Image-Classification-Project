# Image-Classification-Project
Image Classification Project for Face and Digit data(MNIST Dataset) 
In this Project I have build 3 algorithms from scratch namely 
                      1. Baysian Network 
                      2. Perceptron Network
                      3. Mira Percetron
 Here I have used a Face Dataset which have faces made using '*' symbol and we have to identify either the strucure is a face or not (0 or 1) and the second Dataset 
 is a digit Dataset(MNIST) where we have to identify shape of the digit from (0 to 9).
